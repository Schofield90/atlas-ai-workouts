## CRITICAL ISSUES (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)

### üî¥ CRITICAL #1: New Client Page (/clients/new) - Complete Dark Mode Violation
**Severity:** Critical  
**Pages Affected:** `/clients/new`  
**Issue:** Page uses light mode styling (bg-gray-50, bg-white) instead of dark mode  
**Evidence:** Screenshot: `inspection-new-client-form-full.png`  

**Current Code Issues:**
```tsx
// WRONG - Light mode styling
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
<nav className="bg-white shadow-sm border-b">
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">
```

**Expected Dark Mode:**
```tsx
// SHOULD BE - Dark mode styling
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-900">
<nav className="bg-gray-800 shadow-sm border-b border-gray-700">
<div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow p-6">
```

### üî¥ CRITICAL #2: Feedback Page (/feedback) - Complete Dark Mode Violation  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Pages Affected:** `/feedback`  
**Issue:** Entire page uses light mode styling  
**Evidence:** Screenshot: `inspection-feedback-page-full.png`

### üî¥ CRITICAL #3: Workout Builder (/builder) - Dark Mode Violation  
**Severity:** Critical

### üî¥ CRITICAL #5: Login Page - Missing Form Validation  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Pages Affected:** `/login`  
**Issue:** No validation messages shown for empty form submission  
**Security Risk:** Users may not understand authentication requirements  

### üî¥ CRITICAL #6: Body Background Color Inconsistency  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Pages Affected:** All pages  
**Issue:** Despite HTML having `class="dark"`, body shows `background: rgb(255, 255, 255)` (white)  
**Evidence:** All page inspections show this inconsistency  
**Root Cause:** CSS variable `--background` set to white, overriding dark mode classes
