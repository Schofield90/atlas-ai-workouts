# Debug Session Progress - August 31, 2025

## üö® CURRENT ISSUE TO RESOLVE
**The AI workout generation is using fallback/emergency workouts instead of OpenAI**

### What's Happening:
- When creating a workout (e.g., "bicep and tricep"), it returns generic exercises (push-ups, squats) instead of specific ones
- The workout title shows as "Emergency Workout"
- Console shows: `‚ö†Ô∏è Using fallback workout - AI generation may have failed`

### What We Know Works:
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key IS configured in Vercel (164 characters)
- ‚úÖ Test endpoint confirms OpenAI works: `curl https://atlas-ai-workouts.vercel.app/api/test-openai`
- ‚úÖ SOPs are being loaded (8 SOPs with ~200k+ characters total)
- ‚úÖ Context is being sent to the API

### What's Failing:
- ‚ùå The actual workout generation call to OpenAI is failing
- ‚ùå It's falling back to the emergency workout instead

## üîç NEXT STEPS (PICK UP HERE)

### 1. Check Vercel Logs for the Error
```bash
# Go to: https://vercel.com/schofield90s-projects/atlas-ai-workouts/logs
# Look for POST /api/workouts/generate-simple
# Find the error message from OpenAI
```

The logs should show:
- `=== AI Provider Initialization ===`
- `OpenAI key exists: true`
- `‚úÖ OpenAI initialized successfully`
- Then an error message explaining why OpenAI failed

### 2. Common Issues to Check:
- **Invalid model name**: We're using `gpt-4-turbo-preview` - this might not exist
- **Token limit exceeded**: SOPs might be too large
- **Rate limiting**: Too many requests
- **API key permissions**: Key might not have access to GPT-4

## üìù FIXES ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Client Navigation 404 Error - ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Clicking on clients gave 404 error
- **Solution**: Removed problematic rewrite rule in vercel.json

### 2. Client Data Import - ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: 165 clients missing goals/injuries data
- **Solution**: Created script to update from Excel file

### 3. Dark Mode - ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Workout viewer was in light mode
- **Solution**: Updated all components to dark theme

### 4. SOPs Integration - ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: SOPs not being used in generation
- **Solution**: Updated to load from both database and localStorage

### 5. Feedback System - ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Feedback buttons didn't work
- **Solution**: Created chat-style feedback component

### 6. AI Fallback Detection - ‚úÖ PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Problem**: Generic workouts ignoring user requests
- **Solution**: Added focus-specific fallbacks, but main issue is OpenAI failing

## üõ†Ô∏è TEST ENDPOINTS

### Check AI Status
```bash
curl https://atlas-ai-workouts.vercel.app/api/ai-status
```

### Test OpenAI Connection
```bash
curl https://atlas-ai-workouts.vercel.app/api/test-openai
```

### Check SOPs Status
Visit: https://atlas-ai-workouts.vercel.app/sops-check

## üìÇ KEY FILES TO CHECK

### For AI Generation Issues:
- `/lib/ai/provider.ts` - AI provider initialization and calls
- `/app/api/workouts/generate-simple/route.ts` - Workout generation endpoint
- `/app/builder/page.tsx` - Frontend workout builder

### Recent Changes:
- Added detailed logging throughout
- Fixed error handling
- Added fallback detection
- Improved SOPs integration

## üîß LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

### Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Schofield90/atlas-ai-workouts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://lzlrojoaxrqvmhempnkn.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...
```

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT

Everything is deployed to Vercel:
- Production: https://atlas-ai-workouts.vercel.app
- GitHub: https://github.com/Schofield90/atlas-ai-workouts

### To Deploy Updates:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
vercel --prod
```

## üìä CURRENT STATE

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Client management and profiles
- ‚úÖ SOPs management (/context page)
- ‚úÖ Dark mode UI
- ‚úÖ Chat-style feedback
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API connection (test endpoint works)

### What Needs Fixing:
- ‚ùå OpenAI workout generation failing (falling back to emergency workout)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to create workout_sops table in Supabase (currently using localStorage)

## üîç DEBUGGING WORKFLOW

1. **Create a test workout**:
   - Go to https://atlas-ai-workouts.vercel.app/builder
   - Enter "Bicep and Tricep Workout" as title
   - Add "bicep and tricep" in focus field
   - Click Generate

2. **Check Browser Console** (F12):
   - Should see: `Workout generated successfully`
   - Should see: `‚ö†Ô∏è Using fallback workout` (this is the problem)

3. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to logs page
   - Find POST to `/api/workouts/generate-simple`
   - Look for OpenAI error message

4. **Fix Based on Error**:
   - If model doesn't exist: Change to `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`
   - If token limit: Reduce SOPs content size
   - If rate limit: Add retry logic
   - If API key issue: Check/update key in Vercel

## üí° QUICK FIX ATTEMPTS

### Try Different Model:
In `/lib/ai/provider.ts`, line 143:
```typescript
// Change from:
model: process.env.GEN_MODEL || 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
// To:
model: process.env.GEN_MODEL || 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
```

### Reduce Token Usage:
In `/app/api/workouts/generate-simple/route.ts`, line 53:
```typescript
// Change from:
prompt += `${section.content.substring(0, 8000)}\n`
// To:
prompt += `${section.content.substring(0, 2000)}\n`
```
