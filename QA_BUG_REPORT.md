## Critical Issues (Fix Required Before Release)

### BUG-001: Excel Import Theme Inconsistency
**Component**: Clients Page - Excel Import  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P0  

**Description**:  
The clients page uses light mode styling (`bg-gray-50`, `bg-white`) while the rest of the application uses dark mode (`bg-gray-900`, `bg-gray-800`). This creates a jarring user experience inconsistency.

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Navigate to /dashboard (dark theme)
2. Click on "All Clients" link
3. Observe theme switch to light mode

**Expected Behavior**: Consistent dark theme throughout application  
**Actual Behavior**: Clients page shows light theme  

**Files Affected**:  
- `/app/clients/page.tsx` (lines 914-1149)
- `/app/clients/new/page.tsx` (lines 83-304)

**Recommended Fix**:  
Replace all light theme classes:
- `bg-gray-50` → `bg-gray-900`
- `bg-white` → `bg-gray-800`  
- `text-gray-700` → `text-gray-100`
- `border-gray-300` → `border-gray-600`

### BUG-002: SOP Data Loss Risk - localStorage Only
**Component**: SOPs & Context Page  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P0  

**Description**:  
SOPs are only stored in localStorage, creating significant data loss risks. Users will lose all SOPs when clearing browser data, switching devices, or using incognito mode.

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Create SOPs on /context page
2. Clear browser data or switch browsers
3. Return to /context page
4. All SOPs are lost

**Expected Behavior**: SOPs persist across sessions and devices  
**Actual Behavior**: SOPs lost when localStorage is cleared  

**Business Impact**: High - Users lose valuable business processes and training protocols  

**Files Affected**:  
- `/app/context/page.tsx` (lines 37-76)

**Recommended Fix**:  
1. Implement database storage for SOPs in Supabase
2. Add user authentication context
3. Sync localStorage with cloud storage
4. Add data recovery mechanisms

### BUG-003: Excel Import Memory Issues with Large Files
**Component**: Excel Import - Client-side Processing  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P1  

**Description**:  
Client-side processing of large Excel files (168+ sheets) can cause browser memory issues and crashes, especially on mobile devices.

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Create Excel file with 168+ sheets
2. Use "Import Multi-Tab" on mobile device
3. Monitor memory usage during processing
4. Browser may become unresponsive

**Expected Behavior**: Graceful handling of large files  
**Actual Behavior**: Memory overload and potential browser crash  

**Files Affected**:  
- `/app/clients/page.tsx` (lines 541-809)

**Recommended Fix**:  
1. Implement streaming/worker-based processing
2. Add memory usage monitoring
3. Provide file size warnings
4. Add progress indicators for large files

## High Priority Issues

### BUG-004: Inadequate Error Handling in Excel Import
**Component**: Excel Import API Routes  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P1  

**Description**:  
Multiple Excel import endpoints lack comprehensive error handling and user feedback. Users see generic errors without actionable information.

**Files Affected**:  
- `/app/api/clients/import-excel/route.ts`
- `/app/api/clients/import-chunked/route.ts`
- Multiple other import routes

**Issues Found**:  
1. Generic error messages
2. No validation of file formats before processing
3. Missing timeout handling
4. Insufficient logging for debugging

**Recommended Fix**:  
1. Add specific error types and messages
2. Implement file validation before processing
3. Add timeout configurations
4. Improve error logging and user feedback

---

### BUG-005: Mobile Responsiveness Issues
**Component**: Multiple Pages  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P1  

**Issues Found**:

1. **Dashboard Stats Cards**: On very small screens (< 375px), stat cards may overflow
2. **Client Import Buttons**: Four import buttons may not fit on mobile screens
3. **Equipment Selection Grid**: 3-column grid may be too narrow on small devices
4. **SOP Content Display**: Long SOP content may not wrap properly on mobile

**Recommended Fixes**:  
1. Add responsive breakpoints for stat cards
2. Implement responsive button layout (stack on mobile)
3. Make equipment grid single-column on small screens
4. Add word-wrap and overflow handling for SOP content

---

### BUG-006: Input Validation Gaps
**Component**: Form Validation  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P2  

**Issues Found**:  
1. Email validation missing in client forms
2. Phone number format not validated
3. Age/weight/height accept unrealistic values
4. No sanitization of special characters in names

**Files Affected**:  
- `/app/clients/new/page.tsx`
- Client edit forms

**Recommended Solution**:  
Implement Web Workers for heavy Excel processing to keep UI responsive.

---

### BUG-008: Accessibility Issues in Dark Mode
**Component**: UI Components  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Priority**: P2  

**Issues Found**:  
1. Some focus indicators may not meet contrast requirements
2. Error states may not be clearly distinguishable
3. Loading states lack ARIA labels
4. Form validation errors may not be announced to screen readers

---

### BUG-009: Inconsistent Loading States

---

## Security Concerns

### SEC-001: Client-side Data Processing Exposure
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: Excel Import  

**Description**:  
Sensitive client data is processed entirely client-side, potentially exposing it in browser memory longer than necessary.

**Recommendation**:  
Implement server-side processing with proper data sanitization and temporary storage cleanup.

---

### SEC-002: No Input Sanitization
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: All Form Inputs  

**Description**:  
User inputs are not sanitized, potentially allowing XSS attacks through stored client data.

**Recommendation**:  
Implement comprehensive input sanitization on both client and server sides.

---

## Performance Issues

### PERF-001: Large DOM Manipulation
**Component**: Client List Display  
**Severity**: Medium  

**Description**:  
Rendering large client lists (1000+ clients) may cause performance issues due to lack of virtualization.

**Recommendation**:  
Implement virtual scrolling or pagination for large client lists.

---

### PERF-002: Inefficient Re-renders
**Component**: React Components  
**Severity**: Low  

**Description**:  
Some components re-render unnecessarily, potentially impacting performance with large datasets.

**Recommendation**:  
Implement React.memo and useCallback optimizations where appropriate.
