-- Fix RLS policies for workout tables to allow default-user operations
-- This is needed for the import functionality to work

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their organization's clients" ON public.workout_clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow default user operations" ON public.workout_clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read" ON public.workout_clients;

-- Create more permissive policies for development
-- In production, you'd want stricter policies based on actual auth

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users and default-user
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users full access to clients" 
ON public.workout_clients
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Same for workout_sessions
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their organization's workouts" ON public.workout_sessions;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users full access to workouts" 
ON public.workout_sessions
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- For other tables, ensure similar policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own organization" ON public.workout_organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON public.workout_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their organization's feedback" ON public.workout_feedback;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "All authenticated users can view exercises" ON public.workout_exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their organization's messages" ON public.workout_client_messages;

-- Recreate with more permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on organizations" 
ON public.workout_organizations
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on users" 
ON public.workout_users
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on feedback" 
ON public.workout_feedback
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on exercises" 
ON public.workout_exercises
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on messages" 
ON public.workout_client_messages
FOR ALL 
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Note: These policies are very permissive for development
-- In production, you should implement proper auth-based policies
